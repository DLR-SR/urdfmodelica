title: "The DLR URDFModelica Library"
abstract: "The DLR URDFModelica Library is a free open-source library for simulation of robots described as URDF. Given a robot URDF description, a python script translates it to Modelica syntax and automatically builds a package structure to simulate this robot in Modelica. Alternatively a generic robot simulation can be parameterized based on a single Modelica record."
